## Overview

![screenshot](devchallenge001.png)

- Demo is above ^^
- It was hard to find an API that didn't require you to create an account, BUT I FOUND IT!! 
- I did have to adjust somethings because it didn't include some of the attributes, that were in the design, like visibility. But I substituted with other stuff.
